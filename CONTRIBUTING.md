# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our project. Whether it's a bug report, new feature, correction, or
additional documentation, we greatly value feedback and contributions from our community.

Please read through this document before submitting any issues or pull requests to ensure we have all the necessary
information to effectively respond to your bug report or contribution.

## Reporting Bugs/Feature Requests

We welcome you to use the GitHub issue tracker to report bugs or suggest features.

When filing an issue, please check existing open, or recently closed, issues to make sure somebody else hasn't already
reported the issue. Please try to include as much information as you can. Details like these are incredibly useful:

- A reproducible test case or series of steps
- The version of our code being used
- Any modifications you've made relevant to the bug
- Anything unusual about your environment or deployment

## Contributing via Pull Requests

Contributions via pull requests are much appreciated. Before sending us a pull request, please ensure that:

1. **Every PR must be linked to an issue.** Open an issue first (or find an existing one) and reference it in your PR
   using `Closes #issue-number`. PRs without an associated issue will not be reviewed.
2. You are working against the latest source on the _main_ branch.
3. You check existing open, and recently merged, pull requests to make sure someone else hasn't addressed the problem
   already.
4. You open an issue to discuss any significant work - we would hate for your time to be wasted.

To send us a pull request, please:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Modify the source; please focus on the specific change you are contributing. If you also reformat all the code, it
   will be hard for us to focus on your change.
3. Ensure local tests pass.
4. Commit to your fork using clear commit messages.
5. Send us a pull request, answering any default questions in the pull request interface.
6. Pay attention to any automated CI failures reported in the pull request, and stay involved in the conversation.

GitHub provides additional document on [forking a repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and
[creating a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).

## Finding contributions to work on

Looking at the existing issues is a great way to find something to contribute on. As our projects, by default, use the
default GitHub issue labels (enhancement/bug/duplicate/help wanted/invalid/question/wontfix), looking at any 'help
wanted' issues is a great place to start.

## Maintainer notes: Claude security review on community PRs

The `Claude Security Review` workflow runs automatically on maintainer-authored PRs (opened/reopened/synchronize) and on
community PRs once a maintainer applies the **`safe-to-review`** label. PRs from non-collaborators are otherwise skipped
— the label is the gate, so a maintainer must manually review the diff before the automated reviewer runs.

> **Why the label and not an approving review?** GitHub does not inject repo/org secrets into workflows triggered by
> `pull_request_review` events when the PR head is a fork, regardless of the reviewer's access level. The Bedrock OIDC
> role and GitHub App credentials this workflow needs are only available on `pull_request_target` events, so the label
> path is the only one that works end-to-end for fork PRs.

To re-run the review on a later commit, remove and re-apply the label, or trigger the `Claude Security Review` workflow
manually from the Actions tab with the PR number. Note that manual dispatch can verify the analysis and prompt plumbing
but cannot post inline comments — the action's inline-comment MCP server only attaches on PR-context events
(`pull_request_target`).
